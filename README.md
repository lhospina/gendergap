# Visualizing the Gender Gap Across College Degrees

The current project focuses on developing graphical explorations of the gender gap across college degrees.
The Department of Education Statistics released a data set containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. 

The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.
We can investigate the percentage of degree awardees by gender throuhgout the years using various graphs. 
We can manipulate graphs in order to maximize presentation of the data and minimize chartjunk, or any other visual presentation that is not informative.
